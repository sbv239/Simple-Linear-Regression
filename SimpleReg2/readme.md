# Simple Linear Regression with Real 1990 Census Data from California

This project is an exercise in Simple Linear Regression using a dataset based on 1990 census data from California. The focus of this exercise is to choose the right feature for predicting the label by considering both correlation and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). This dataset, despite its age, offers a valuable opportunity to learn about machine learning programming and explore the fundamentals of regression analysis.
